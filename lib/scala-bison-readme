ScalaBison -- Generate LAXLC(1) parsers in Scala from bison input and output files.

Release Notes
Version 0.83, October 2012

Please see LICENSE for software licensing.

(1) Compiling ScalaBison

  ScalaBison is bootstrapped through itself.  Thus you need
  scalabison.jar before you can build ScalaBison, and thus create
  the JAR file.

  You can download scala-bison.jar from github:
	https://github.com/downloads/djspiewak/scala-bison/scala-bison.jar

  Then using "make"
	make boot
	make compile
	make
  This will create your own scala-bison.jar file (deleting the old one
  in the process).  Then you should repeat the bootstrapping process:
	make boot
	make compile
	make
  Now you have a scala-bison generated and compiled by itself.


(2) Installation

  There is no automatic installation.  You may find the script
	cmd/scala-bison
  useful.


(3) Using ScalaBison

  In lieu of documentation: here's the basic way to use ScalaBison

  (a) Create a bison-style xxx.y file.  
      Unlike bison, ScalaBison requires every grammar production
      to end with a semicolon.  (Semicolons are optional in bison).

  (b) Run bison, as in:
	bison -v xxx.y
      Discard/ignore the xxx.tab.x file.

  (c) Run ScalaBison, using:
	scala -cp scala-bison.jar -howtorun:object edu.uwm.cs.scalabison.RunGenerator [-t] [-v] xxx.y
      The result is in xxx.scala
